This repository is an example required for Task 25 of the Python for Data Science Module in the Imperial
College London Data Science Bootcamp by HyperionDev.

The inventory.py file contains code written in python to model an inventory of shoes available for sale in stock. It consists of a shoe class with variables holding information related to the cost, quantity, name of product, country of origin and product code. Various functions exist to enable options such as viewing all the shoes in the inventory, adding a new shoe to the inventory, restocking the lowest quantity option in the inventory, searching for a shoe by its code, viewing the value of each shoe item and viewing the highest quantity option for sale available.

The inventory.txt file contains the data for all shoes stored in the inventory which is retrieved by the code in the inventory.py file and updated by the code when necessary.
